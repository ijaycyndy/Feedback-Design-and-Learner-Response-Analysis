1,critic,raw,"School uniforms should be banned because students need freedom to express themselves, but some people think uniforms help with discipline and focus. I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","1. Clarity: The paragraph mixes two opposing views in one sentence, which makes it confusing. Instead of combining “students need freedom” and “some people think uniforms help discipline” in one sentence, separate these ideas clearly. Also, the phrase “it does not always improve behaviour” is vague—specify what “it” refers to (uniforms) and explain why.

2. Structure: The paragraph lacks a clear topic sentence and supporting details. Start with a clear topic sentence stating your main argument (e.g., “School uniforms should be banned because they restrict students’ self-expression and do not guarantee better behaviour.”). Then, add at least two sentences explaining why uniforms are unfair and ineffective, with examples or reasoning.

3. Strength of argument: The paragraph states opinions but does not provide reasons or evidence. Explain why uniforms make students uncomfortable (e.g., lack of individuality) and why they fail to improve behaviour (e.g., studies or logical reasoning). This will make your argument more convincing.

4. Suggestions for improvement: Rewrite the paragraph to have a clear topic sentence, separate opposing views into different sentences, and provide specific reasons supporting your opinion. For example, explain how uniforms limit freedom and why discipline is not necessarily improved. Adding examples or evidence will strengthen your argument.","1.

I believe they are unfair because not everyone feels comfortable wearing the same thing and it does not always improve behaviour.","Here is feedback you can use to improve your paragraph:

1. Clarity:
- Your main idea is clear: you believe school uniforms should be banned because they are unfair and don’t always help behavior.
- To make it clearer, try to state your opinion in one strong sentence at the beginning. For example: “I believe school uniforms should be banned because they limit students’ freedom and do not improve behavior.”
- Avoid vague phrases like “some people think” without explaining why they think that.

2. Structure:
- Your paragraph has two ideas: freedom of expression and uniforms not improving behavior. These are good points but they feel a bit mixed together.
- Try to organize your paragraph with one main idea per sentence. For example:
  - Sentence 1: State your opinion clearly.
  - Sentence 2: Explain why students need freedom to express themselves.
  - Sentence 3: Explain why uniforms do not always improve behavior.
- This will make your paragraph easier to follow.

3. Strength of argument:
- You mention uniforms help discipline and focus but don’t explain why some people think that or why you disagree.

- Adding examples or reasons makes your argument stronger.

4. Suggestions for improvement:
- Rewrite your topic sentence to clearly state your opinion.
- Separate your ideas into clear sentences.
- Add a sentence explaining the opposing view.

1. Clarity:
- Your ideas are clear but a bit general. Try to be more specific about what you mean by “getting worse” and “real changes are slow.”
- Example: Instead of “Climate change is getting worse,” you could say “Global temperatures have risen by 1.2 degrees Celsius in the past century, causing more extreme weather.”

2. Structure:
- Your paragraph has a basic structure but could be improved by grouping similar ideas together and using transition words.
- For example, start with the problem (climate change and fossil fuels), then discuss government actions, then individual actions, and finally the gap between efforts.
- Use transition words like “however,” “although,” or “despite” to connect ideas smoothly.

3. Strength of Argument:
- Your argument is that individual efforts feel small compared to big companies, but you don’t provide examples or evidence.
- Add a specific example or fact, such as “Big companies are responsible for nearly 70% of global carbon emissions, which makes individual recycling efforts seem less impactful.”
- This will make your argument stronger and more convincing.

4. Suggestions for Improvement:
- Add specific facts or statistics to support your points.
- Use transition words to improve flow.
- Clarify vague phrases by explaining them or giving examples.
- Consider ending with a sentence that suggests a solution or calls for stronger action.

Revised example paragraph:

Climate change is becoming more severe, with global temperatures rising by 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last century, leading to extreme weather events. Despite knowing this, many countries continue to burn fossil fuels, which release harmful greenhouse gases. Governments often talk about taking action; however, real policy changes and reductions in emissions have been slow. While individuals recycle and try to reduce waste, these efforts seem small compared to the impact of big companies, which are responsible for nearly 70% of global carbon emissions. To effectively combat climate change, stronger regulations on corporations and increased global cooperation are necessary.

Climate change is becoming more severe, with global temperatures rising by 1.2 degrees Celsius in the last century, leading to extreme weather events. Despite knowing this, many countries continue to burn fossil fuels, which release harmful greenhouse gases. Governments often talk about taking action; however, real policy changes and reductions in emissions have been slow. While individuals recycle and try to reduce waste, these efforts seem small compared to the impact of big companies, which are responsible for nearly 70% of global carbon emissions. To effectively combat climate change, stronger regulations on corporations and increased global cooperation are necessary.

- The paragraph would be stronger if you organized it logically. Start with the problem (climate change getting worse), then explain the causes (countries burning fossil fuels), followed by the responses (government talks and individual efforts), and end with your conclusion or opinion.
- Each sentence should connect smoothly to the next. For example, after mentioning fossil fuels, explain why governments’ slow changes matter, then discuss individual efforts.

3. Strength of argument:
- You make good points, but your argument would be stronger with examples or evidence. For instance, name some countries still heavily reliant on fossil fuels or mention specific government policies that are slow to change.
- Explain why individual actions like recycling are not enough compared to big companies. This will make your argument more convincing.

People recycle and try to reduce waste, but it feels small compared to what big companies do.","Here is clear, combined feedback to help you improve your paragraph:

1. **Clarify Your Ideas**  
   - Replace vague phrases like “getting worse” and “feels small” with specific details or examples.  
   - For example, say “Global temperatures have risen by 1.2°C in the last century, causing more extreme weather” instead of “climate change is getting worse.”  
   - Explain why government changes are slow and why individual actions seem less impactful.

2. **Organize Your Paragraph Clearly**  
   - Start with a strong topic sentence stating your main argument about climate change and insufficient action.  
   - Follow a logical order: describe the problem (climate change and fossil fuel use), then government responses, then individual efforts, and finish with your conclusion or opinion.  
   - Use transition words like “however,” “although,” or “despite” to connect ideas smoothly.

3. **Strengthen Your Argument with Examples and Evidence**  
   - Support your points with specific facts or examples, such as naming countries still reliant on fossil fuels or citing that big companies contribute nearly 70% of global carbon emissions.  
   - Explain why individual efforts like recycling, while important, are limited compared to corporate impact.

4. **Improve Sentence Variety and Flow**  
   - Vary how you start sentences to avoid repetition (avoid starting many sentences with “People” or “Governments”).  
   - Combine related ideas to make your writing smoother and more engaging.

5. **End with a Clear Conclusion or Call to Action**  
   - Summarize your main point or suggest a solution, such as stronger government regulations or increased global cooperation to combat climate change effectively.
